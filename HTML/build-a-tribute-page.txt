      <h2 id="tribute-info">Here's a time line of Darwin's life:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="bold">1809</span> - Born in Shropshire, England</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1817</span> - Darwin starts school</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1825</span> - Becomes a doctor's apprentice</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1827</span> - Darwin reads his grandfather, Erasmus Darwin's journals which contain his ideas about evolutionary theory.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1828</span> - Darwin neglected his medical studies so his father sent him to the University of Cambridge to study theology.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">27 December 1831</span> - Darwinâ€™s uncle, Josiah Wedgwood II, convinced his father it was a good idea to allow Darwin to go on the voyage that would take five years to complete.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1837</span> - Darwin completes his notes about his time on the Beagle, now commonly known as The Voyage of the Beagle. It was published along with Captain Fitzroy's own notes in 1839.
</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1839</span> - Darwin married his first cousin Emma after writing about the pros and cons of marriage in his notebook. Pros included having a "friend in old age ... better than a dog anyhow", but cons included that he would have "less money for books".
</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1 July 1858
</span> - Darwin's friend Charles Lyell read a paper by Alfred Russel Wallace and told Darwin to publish his ideas so he would get the recognition, however, Darwin did not see Wallace as a threat and the two scientists both had their work presented at the Linnean Society at the same time.
</li>
        <li><span class="bold">22 November 1859
</span> - On the Origin of Species is published.
</li>

      <p class="quote">"Charles Darwin made arguably the greatest discovery any human has ever made. He was a man of great persistence. He wasn't probably a natural genius, he worked very hard - even though he was an invalid. He was a great family man, a very nice man. I think he was admirable in all sorts of ways."
