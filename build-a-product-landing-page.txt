    <h2 id="what-we-offer">What we offer</h2>
    <p>Game-based mentoring is a proposal in which situations with a socio-emotional impact are modeled through board games. In this context, we accompany boys and girls to offer them tools for emotional management and social inclusion. During the sessions we also observe and evaluate strengths and difficulties in which some type of psycho-pedagogical support can proceed.</p>

<p>Although today there is an important movement in the field of Game-Based Learning, which puts the weight of the process on the mechanics of the game used, what we propose is to use games to propose scenarios of social interaction that we can anticipate and model. to provide situations in which they can practice respectful and healthy socialization. What is important is not what happens on the table, but around it.</p>
